# StupidChessEngine

Very simple, very slow and very stupid python chess engine.

It can also play a minichess variant.

It can play against itself by inputting "autoplay" instead of a specific move.

## To play:

1. Install the python-chess library ( https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/ )

2. Run 'startgame.py'
